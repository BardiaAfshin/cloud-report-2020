# cloud-report-2019

Details about and from the Cloud Report done in Q3 2019

In 2018, we produced a "Cloud Report", wherein we assessed the performance of AWS vs. GCP along dimensions like TPC-C throughput, I/O, CPU and latency. This year, we aim to produce a similar report but including Azure.

This repo will let us aggregate and share data among team members, including processes and results.
